## 1.Can you explain the concept of signals in programming? How are they used in Unixlike operating systems?
```
A signal is a software interrupt sent by the Unix/Linux operating system to a process to inform it that some event or condition has occurred.
Why Are Signals Used?
1. Interrupt or Terminate Processes
Examples:
SIGINT – Interrupt (usually Ctrl + C)
SIGTERM – Request process termination (graceful)
SIGKILL – Force kill (cannot be ignored or handled).
2. Notify System Events
Example:
SIGCHLD – Sent to a parent when a child process finishes or stops.
3. Handle Errors/Exceptions
Examples:
SIGFPE – Arithmetic error (e.g., divide by zero)
SIGSEGV – Invalid memory access (segmentation fault).
4. Control Process Execution
Examples:
SIGSTOP – Pause/suspend a process
SIGCONT – Resume a paused process.
```
## 2.What are software interrupts and hardware interrupts and mention potential issues when dealing with them?
```
Software Interrupts
These are interrupts triggered by software/programs.
Example: a program calling a system call (like int 0x80), or sending a signal using kill.
They help a program request services from the OS.
Hardware Interrupts
These are interrupts generated by hardware devices.
Example: Keyboard key press, mouse movement, timer, network device.
They tell the CPU that hardware needs attention.
Potential Issues When Dealing With Interrupts
Race conditions – interrupt may occur while shared data is being modified.
Interrupt loss – too many interrupts may cause some to be missed.
Unexpected behavior – interrupts may occur at any time and break normal flow.
Deadlocks – if an interrupt tries to access a locked resource.
Performance overhead – too many interrupts can slow down the system.
```
## 3.What is synchronous signal and asynchronous signal and how the process can be used for both?
```
An asynchronous signal comes from outside the process.
It can happen at any time, not because of the process’s current instruction.
Examples:
SIGINT → user presses Ctrl+C
SIGTERM → another process sends kill
SIGCHLD → child process ends.
How the process uses it?
The process can handle it using a signal handler (like sigaction), or if not handled, it usually gets terminated.
Asynchronous Signal
An asynchronous signal comes from outside the process.
It can happen at any time, not because of the process’s current instruction.
Examples:
SIGINT → user presses Ctrl+C
SIGTERM → another process sends kill
SIGCHLD → child process ends
How the process uses it?
The process can install a handler to catch the signal and decide what to do (ignore, print message, cleanup, etc.).
| Type             | Triggered By               | Example         | Timing                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**  | Process’s own action/error | SIGFPE, SIGSEGV | At the faulting instruction |
| **Asynchronous** | External events            | SIGINT, SIGTERM | Anytime                     |
```
## 4.Who is responsible for generating signals?
```
The Kernel (Operating System)
Generated automatically when something happens in the system.
Examples:
Division by zero → SIGFPE
Invalid memory access → SIGSEGV
Child process finished → SIGCHLD.
Other Processes
A process can send a signal to another process.
Using commands or system calls:
kill(pid, SIGTERM)
kill -9 pid
This is used for control or communication.
The User
Through keyboard actions.
Example:
Pressing Ctrl + C → sends SIGINT
Pressing Ctrl + Z → sends SIGTSTP
The terminal sends the signal on behalf of the user.
```
## 5.What is signal handler?
```
A signal handler is a function that runs when a signal is delivered to a process.
Instead of the program stopping or doing the default action, the handler lets you decide what should happen.
EX-Normally, Ctrl + C (SIGINT) stops a program.
If you set a signal handler, you can make it:
Print a message
Save data
Clean up
Or do anything you want
```
## 6.Which system call is used to send a signal to the process?
```
kill(pid, signal_number);
```
## 7.Write a program to send a signal to itself (same process)?
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void handler(int signo){
printf("signal number=%d\n",signo);
}
int main(){
signal(SIGINT,handler);
printf("Passing a sinal to my self\n");
kill(getpid(),SIGINT);
}
```
## 8.Explain the default action associated with the SIGKILL signal?
```
SIGKILL forcefully kills the process instantly, with no chance to handle or stop it.
Default Action of SIGKILL
Immediate termination of the process
No cleanup (files not closed, memory not freed by the program)
Cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.
```
## 9.How does a process handle a signal while it is executing in kernel mode?
```
If a signal arrives while the process is in kernel mode, it is not handled immediately.
The signal is marked as pending.
Once the process returns from kernel mode to user mode, the kernel checks for pending signals.
Then the signal is delivered and:
Default action happens or
The signal handler runs (if installed)
No signal handler can handle it.
```
## 10.Describe the behaviour of a process when it receives a SIGSEGV signal?
```
SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault) happens when a process accesses invalid memory (like dereferencing a bad pointer).
What happens by default?
1️⃣ The kernel sends SIGSEGV to the process.
2️⃣ The process is immediately terminated.
3️⃣ A core dump may be created (if enabled) for debugging.
SIGSEGV means memory error, and the default action is to kill the process (often with a core dump)
```
